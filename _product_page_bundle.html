    <p>The Harmonic trading is a technique that uses the recognition of specific figures based on the Fibonacci ratios and applied on prices to determine the reversal points (potential reversal zone – PRZ) highly probable. As often in Chart analysis, the goal is to identify the figures, and the entry and exit of a position by the assumption that the price action in the past will happen again in the future.</p>

    <p>One of the first references to Harmonic Trading can be found in the work of J. M. Hurst. It was developed and popularized by Scott M Carney, who  wrote several books about this subject, and few others, like for example Darren Oglesbee who discovered the Cypher pattern.</p>

    <p>The important concept to understand is that the separate price movements of each other are actually related. In addition, the Fibonacci ratios and patterns on prices of their relationship provide a way to determine where the turning points will occur. When these points are identified correctly, trades are executed at a price level where the cycle is potentially changing.</p>

    <p>These trades are executed “in harmony” with the market. Transactions are executed in areas where the rhythmic nature of the market is changing. In addition, these technical measures can provide a lot of technical information about the potential direction of future price action.</p>

    <p>This is particularly evident when the calculation of several harmonics converge in a specific price zone, defining a support or resistance. This area is known as the “potential Reversal Zone” or (PRZ).</p>

      <h4>Automate your Harmonic Trading</h4>
      <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>Applied manually Harmonic trading techniques can not be used on any time frame. The reason is that this technique is enormously time-consuming in terms of analysis. It is best to use on daily, weekly and monthly charts.</p>
        <p>If you want to trade Harmonic patterns on lower time frames, you have to master the theory and be able to identifies patterns just by looking to the chart. You must know the exact ratio for each wave and for each pattern.</p>
        <p>Or, you can use an automated tool to find Harmonic patterns in real-time, on any time frame and instrument like the Harmonic Indicator.</p>
        <p>Sure, automation is rigid and not always right, in a sens that someone who master harmonic trading may find other patterns even if they are not 100% conform to the theory, by adding its own feeling and by taking into account the market context.</p>
        <p>But automation is the first process to learn how to apply something theoretical and to help you avoid hesitation. With this tool, you have on your chart, in real-time whatever the time frame, every pattern conform to the theory. Then you can perform your own analysis by taking the context into account and other personal factors to decide either to enter or not in the market.</p>

        <p>It can detect ABCD / Bat / Butterfly / Crab / Cypher / Gartley / Shark / 5-0 / 3Drive patterns.</p>
        <p>The indicator can also show the figures before they are 100% valid (displayed in dash lines). Since the apparition of the preceding PRZ point, it is possible to know the future configuration to trade and thus to anticipate the entry point at the PRZ.</p>
        <p>You can also disable this option to only show the valid patterns.</p>
        <p>The PRZ is an area where prices have a high probability of recovery. According to the harmonic theory, this zone is the optimal entry point to enter the initial movement with a low risk of failure. The indicator respects the theory, but it is possible to add a degree of freedom by allowing to exceed this area without compromising the validation of the pattern.</p>
        <p>Similarly, it is possible to define a theoretical error margin around the exact level of each anchor of the pattern.</p>
        <p>For each pattern, you can display the Guide lines and choose to display the Volumes.</p>

      <p>Important Notice : Trading Risks Investment and trading on a margin account involves a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors . The high degree of leverage can work in your favor as well as against you. It is desirable before you engage in trading operations, taking into account your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. We insist on the fact that the trading of stocks, futures, cfd's, options and other instruments is not suitable for all investors. There is a risk of losing some, all, or in the case of futures and cfd's, more than all of your initial capital. Each investor must make their own judgments about the appropriateness of investing in any financial product, taking into account the merits and risks associated with it, its own investment strategy and their legal status, tax and financial . You should therefore avoid invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You must be aware of all the risks associated with transactions in financial products and it is recommended, in case of doubt, consult an independent financial adviser. The risk of loss in trading can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. If you purchase or sell Equities, Futures, Currencies, CFDs or Options you may sustain a total loss of the initial margin funds and any additional funds that you deposit with your broker to establish or maintain your position. If the market moves against your position, you may be called upon by your broker to deposit a substantial amount of additional margin funds, on short notice in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required funds within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you may be liable for any resulting deficit in your account. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market makes a "limit move". The placement of contingent orders by you, such as a "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" order, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.</p>
      <p>RISK DISCLOSURE : Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones financial security or life style. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.</p>
      <p>HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE DISCLAIMER : HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN; IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK OF ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT TRADING RESULTS.</p>
