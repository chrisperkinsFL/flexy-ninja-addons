    <p>Chartist Analysis is a technique that uses the recognition of specific figures based on major pivot points. Unlike Harmonic Theory, it is not based on the Fibonacci but rather on the pattern itself and help to better understand the psychology of the market at a certain moment. As often in Chart analysis, the goal is to identify the figures, and the entry and exit of a position by the assumption that the price action in the past will happen again in the future.</p>

    <p>Here is a list of recognized patterns by the Chartist Indicator :</p>

    <p><b>Double and Triple Top/Bottom:</b> Double and triple top/bottom patterns are generally used to get a thorough idea on how the current stock trend may shift over a particular course of time. The top formations occur in the uptrend whereas their counterparts take place in case of downtrend.</p>

    <p><b>Cup with Handle:</b> The cup-and-handle pattern is preceded by an upward move, which pauses and sells off. The sell-off is the initial part of this pattern. After the sell-off, the security typically trades flat for a long period of time without any clear trend. The next part of the pattern comprises a rise towards the peak of the preceding upward move. The final part of the pattern, the handle, is a comparatively smaller downward move before the security continues the previous trend of moving higher.</p>

    <p><b>Head and Shoulders:</b> The head-and-shoulders pattern refers to a specific chart formation which predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. It is held to be one of the most dependable trend reversal patterns. Notably, it is one of the top patterns that indicates that an upward trend is nearing its end.</p>

    <p><b>Ascending/Descending Triangle:</b> This triangle shows a strong level of horizontal support or resistance, which, when broken, announces the continuation of the initial trend. As for the other figures, it is better to wait for a pullback to enter.</p>

    <p><b>Symmetric Triangle:</b> This triangle is formed by weakening pulse and corrections marking a sharp indecision regarding the release of the movement. Although this figure is difficult to trade, it can show good trade opportunities.</p>

    <p><b>Rectangle:</b> This figure detects periods of range. According to the chartist theory, this figure should be broken in the same direction as the original trend. However, a false breakout in the opposite direction, which makes even better opportunity to trade, is often observed.</p>

    <p><b>Flag:</b> A Flag is a correction in an initial trend. When the flag is broken in the same direction as the initial movement, it often gives rise to a strong continuation. This is probably the figure having the best success rate, even if the entry point is difficult to catch.</p>

      <h4>Automate your Charting Analysis</h4>
      <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>This indicator simplifies the detection of classical chartist patterns, by analyzing multiple variations of a zigzag on multiple time frames.</p>
        <p>No more searching for the best anchor points to draw the figures. No more hesitation between one pivot point and another. No need either to know by heart all the different kind of patterns. This indicator does it automatically for you whatever the time frame or the instrument you choose.</p>
        <p>The pattern is drawn on the chart, as soon as the pattern is considered valid by the indicator. It doesn’t mean that it will work, but you can use it as an edge in your trading and have a bullish or bearish bias for the next movement to come. On the very small figures, it often happens that the trend is already gone, but it doesn’t change the validity of the figure and you can try to take the pullback, if any, to enter in the trend.</p>

      <p>Important Notice : Trading Risks Investment and trading on a margin account involves a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors . The high degree of leverage can work in your favor as well as against you. It is desirable before you engage in trading operations, taking into account your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. We insist on the fact that the trading of stocks, futures, cfd's, options and other instruments is not suitable for all investors. There is a risk of losing some, all, or in the case of futures and cfd's, more than all of your initial capital. Each investor must make their own judgments about the appropriateness of investing in any financial product, taking into account the merits and risks associated with it, its own investment strategy and their legal status, tax and financial . You should therefore avoid invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You must be aware of all the risks associated with transactions in financial products and it is recommended, in case of doubt, consult an independent financial adviser. The risk of loss in trading can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. If you purchase or sell Equities, Futures, Currencies, CFDs or Options you may sustain a total loss of the initial margin funds and any additional funds that you deposit with your broker to establish or maintain your position. If the market moves against your position, you may be called upon by your broker to deposit a substantial amount of additional margin funds, on short notice in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required funds within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you may be liable for any resulting deficit in your account. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market makes a "limit move". The placement of contingent orders by you, such as a "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" order, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.</p>
      <p>RISK DISCLOSURE : Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones financial security or life style. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.</p>
      <p>HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE DISCLAIMER : HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN; IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK OF ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT TRADING RESULTS.</p>
