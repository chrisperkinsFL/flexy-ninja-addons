    <p>Fortunately, our Radar Tape comes with features that allow you to train. First, all aggregate levels are recorded, so you can analyze them later and improve your technique by training on historical data. Second, the Radar Tape can be used with the Market Replay. This allows you to record aggregate levels of the past sessions, and so to train on simulator, and have a significant history of levels to build your own strategy.</p>

      <h4>Visualization</h4>
      <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>Thanks to the Radar Tape, you can visualize iceberg orders directly on your chart. These orders are separated in 4 customizable categories, then displayed with the bid/ask information (in whole level perspective), and also with the total amount of contracts exchanged. The zones are indicated by a colored rectangle (which may be extended), to be seen more easily. Each category can be displayed/hidden and set individually.</p>
        <p>The display of these levels on the chart makes it easier to see the price on which it has had such strong trade and thus detect areas of support / resistance, break-out or acceleration phases. These are crucial information to confirm a level of S/R or to go out of your position without giving back all your gains.</p>
        <p>You can choose from 2 types of algorithms to detect Iceberg orders. The first, called Heavy, is best on very liquid instruments such as ES or FESX. It filters small exchanges passed between bigger. The second, called Light takes into account all orders and will work only on illiquid markets, such as the FCE or FDAX (depending on trading periods). These two algorithms analyze the volume of trades, their recurrence around the same level and their frequency to determine a good support / resistance price area.</p>

      <h4>Features</h4>
      <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p><b>The Basic Tape</b><br />Displays all exchanges on the underlying market by organizing the information by columns and using a color code to synthesize this information as follows :</p>
        <p>The time of the exchange in the first column.</p>
        <p>The pace of the tape, in order to know whether if the market is quiet or not. This is indicated by the color gradient in the time column . The clearer the color is, the faster the exchanges are. This option can be turned off directly from the toolbar.</p>
        <p>The price of the exchange in the second column. The background color indicates if the bid or ask side has been hit during the exchange. The font color indicates whether if the price has changed (black) or if it is still the same (white). If prices make a new daily high or low, a specific color is used.</p>
        <p>The third column also indicates if the exchange is an uptick (+) or downtick (-) more immediately.</p>
        <p>The fourth column shows the volume of trade. The color indicates whether it is an up / down / same tick.</p>
        <p>Finally, the last column displays a message when an abnormal volume is detected. It is one or several consecutive exchanges where the total is higher than a threshold level. PAQ : Package / BLK : Block / BIG : Big volume / IST : Institutional. Levels can be set directly from the toolbar and can be changed or disabled in real time.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <p><b>The Aggregate Tape</b><br />Displays iceberg orders automatically detected by the indicator. It displays the summary of the iceberg order, and the detail can also be displayed by clicking on the [+] icon.</p>
        <p>As for the Basic Tape, the information is arranged in columns with the same color code. The iceberg orders synthesis differs slightly in the information displayed </p>
        <p>The time of the exchange in the first column.</p>
        <p>The maximum price of the iceberg order in the second column.</p>
        <p>The minimum price of the iceberg order in the third column.</p>
        <p>The fourth column shows the total volume of the iceberg order.</p>
        <p>Finally, the last column displays the type of order (PAQ/BLK/BIG/IST). Levels are also configurable directly from the toolbar and can be changed or disabled in real time.</p>
        <p>This tape can also be paused directly from the toolbar.</p>

      <p>Important Notice : Trading Risks Investment and trading on a margin account involves a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors . The high degree of leverage can work in your favor as well as against you. It is desirable before you engage in trading operations, taking into account your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. We insist on the fact that the trading of stocks, futures, cfd's, options and other instruments is not suitable for all investors. There is a risk of losing some, all, or in the case of futures and cfd's, more than all of your initial capital. Each investor must make their own judgments about the appropriateness of investing in any financial product, taking into account the merits and risks associated with it, its own investment strategy and their legal status, tax and financial . You should therefore avoid invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You must be aware of all the risks associated with transactions in financial products and it is recommended, in case of doubt, consult an independent financial adviser. The risk of loss in trading can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. If you purchase or sell Equities, Futures, Currencies, CFDs or Options you may sustain a total loss of the initial margin funds and any additional funds that you deposit with your broker to establish or maintain your position. If the market moves against your position, you may be called upon by your broker to deposit a substantial amount of additional margin funds, on short notice in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required funds within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you may be liable for any resulting deficit in your account. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market makes a "limit move". The placement of contingent orders by you, such as a "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" order, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.</p>
      <p>RISK DISCLOSURE : Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones financial security or life style. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.</p>
      <p>HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE DISCLAIMER : HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN; IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK OF ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT TRADING RESULTS.</p>
