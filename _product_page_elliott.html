      <h4>Elliott Made Simple</h4>
      <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>The Elliott theory applied rigidly, is very difficult to implement in real time. And there’s really no use to find a countdown when the trend is already over.</p>
        <p>However, the use of this indicator can help you truly trade by applying the principles of this theory. You just have to open a chart, choose the type of countdown to display (bullish / bearish, or both), and adjust the zigzag. Adjust the zigzag’s speed so as to have waves of a size that is convenient for you to trade and that suits the volatility of the moment. And that’s it!</p>
        <p>The indicator will detect automatically countdowns in progress, and you can use this information to place your Entry and/or Exit orders.</p>
        <p>For example, you can wait for the appearance of the W2 PRZ. This area can be used as an entry area, which coupled with a level Iceberg spotted by the Radar Tape, will form an excellent entry level to trade the next impulse wave.
          You can try to enter in a W2 and remain in position until it is invalidated, thanks to the ILVs. This way you can trade the W3 to its objective level.</p>
        <p>You can also try to reinforce your position in a W4 pullback, in order to trade the movement until the end of the W5.</p>
        <p>Once well mastered, the Elliott Indicator is a great tool to narrow your trading decisions, showing you the areas and levels with high potential, while showing you the general context (on an Elliott point of view) in which you are trading.</p>

        <p><b>Boost Entry & Amp; Exit Confidence With PRZ and ILVs</b></p>
        <p>The Elliott Indicator introduces the concept of PRZ (from the Harmonic Theory) to help find good entry points and objectives zones. It is an area where prices should (at least) pause on a corrective or impulsive wave.</p>
        <p>ILVs (Invalidation/Limit/Validation) levels allow you to view at any time, at which price the wave is validate or not. The term limit is the border between two waves. Eg w2b becomes a w3 or w3.1 if it exceeds the limit level (usually the top of w1).</p>

        <p>Display or Hide bullish / bearish countdowns independently.</p>
        <p>Display or Hide ILVs levels that allow you to know the important levels on the current countdown.</p>
        <p>Display or Hide PRZs area, which are, according to the theory, important zones of reversal.</p>
        <p>Display or Hide the zigzag used to calculate the countdown.</p>
        <p>Modify in real-time, the parameters of the zigzag, like its speed, its type and its price level used in its calculations (HL or Input).</p>
