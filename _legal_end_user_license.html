    <p>(f) Compliance with Applicable Laws: You must comply with all applicable laws regarding use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under rover compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs, in general, are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.</p>
    <p class="fw-bold">3. NO WARRANTIES</p>
    <p>Traders Innovation LLC clearly disclaims any warranty for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is provided ‘As Is’ without any express or implied warranty of any kind, including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, or fitness of a particular purpose.

    <p class="fw-bold">5. FULL RISK DISCLOSURE</p>
    <p>FUTURES TRADING CONTAINS SUBSTANTIAL RISK AND IS NOT FOR EVERY INVESTOR. AN INVESTOR COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE ALL OR MORE THAN THE INITIAL INVESTMENT. RISK CAPITAL IS MONEY THAT CAN BE LOST WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ONE’S FINANCIAL SECURITY OR LIFE STYLE.

    <p class="fw-bold">6. CFTC RULE 4.41</p>
    <p>HYPOTHETICAL OR SIMULATED PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. UNLIKE AN ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RECORD, SIMULATED RESULTS DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL TRADING. ALSO, SINCE THE TRADES HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, THE RESULTS MAY HAVE UNDER-OR-OVER COMPENSATED FOR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF CERTAIN MARKET FACTORS, SUCH AS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. SIMULATED TRADING PROGRAMS IN GENERAL ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFIT OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN.</p>

Ninja-addons.com contains copyrighted material which is owned by the company Traders Innovation LLC including but not limited to: indicators, systems, strategies, software code, methodologies, techniques, trademarks, brand names, graphics, logos, PDFs and or any trading manuals. If You, as a customer, have purchased any materials from Ninja-Addons.com, you are forbidden from republishing, sharing, copying, selling, licensing, uploading, rebranding, unlocking or reproducing them. Any purchase of any software code or trading manuals, may not be incorporated into any competitor’s product code, website, or trading systems or strategies without our written warranty.</p>

    <p>2. Delivery : Ninja-Addons.com will send an e-mail within the period of 48 hours of working day, provided that a valid email address and “NinjaTrader Machine ID” is received. During this time period, you can exercise your right of withdrawing the purchase of our product as defined in Chapter 3.3. In the event that the e-mail address and/or “NinjaTrader Machine ID” is invalid, the delivery may be delayed and/or the Ninja-Addons.com and Traders Innovation LLC will not be liable.</p>

    <p>3. Cancellation: You have the possibility to exercise your right of withdrawal without any reason or incurring penalty if product delivery has not begun.​ You cannot exercise your right of withdrawal when product delivery has started, which means the transaction is final. We emphasize that in accordance with the European Directive on consumer rights, particularly Article 16 section m, which states that “Member States do not provide the right of withdrawal (…) in terms of distance contracts (…) in relation to the following: the supply of digital content not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the express prior consent of the consumer, which also acknowledged that he will lose its right of withdrawal.”. Therefore, by downloading the software, you acknowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal and no refund will be granted.</p>

    <p>4. All software sales are final. We provide for each indicator, a Trial version of 14 days non-renewable. This version is the same as the paid version. After this trial period you are free to purchase the software or not. If you do not, you agree to uninstall all files, binary code and other resources contained in the installation package using the uninstaller provided by Ninja-Addons.com.</p>

    <p>5. You shall not retain any copy of the content of the archive and you understand that after disabling your trial license, the use after the trial period is illegal and may have adverse effects on NinjaTrader platform and more widely in your trading. Traders Innovation LLC cannot be held responsible for any subsequent financial loss if the expired trial version is used.</p>

    <p>6. If after the trial period, you are satisfied and want to buy the software, you accept the fact that there is no return or credit possible, once the order is placed on the website and your credit card has been debited. You cannot return the product and request for a refund once we have provided the software and copyrighted material, as you can easily make a copy, which is illegal. Once you have ordered and your payment is received, all sales are final, whether or not you tried the sofwtare in its Trial version first.</p>

    <p>7. License Authentication: To protect our software from illegal copying and unauthorized use, we perform a license authentication using the “NinjaTrader vendor Licensing”, as well as our own license manager on our server. This means that checking our license server will be performed each time you use our software. Personal information provided during this audit are your “NinjaTrader MachineID”, and your IP address. This means that an Internet connection is required to use our software. However, be aware that the fact of not having an Internet connection cannot constitute a valid reason for a refund. We remind you that a free trial period is available for every sofware.</p>

    <p>8. Change of Machine ID: Each software is sold for a single end user, the use of which must be on a single computer. The MachineID provided when the software was purchased is the basis for the protection of our software, and is an effective way to limit the use to one and the same person. However, MachineID is based on the hardware configuration, and given the fact that the hardware may change, we allow a single change of MachineID per user, per calendar year. This is to prevent the resale of our software to a third party or any other use not in accordance with section 3.1. Beyond one change by calendar year, we exceptionally authorize an additional change. In this case, the company Traders Innovation LLC reserves the right to request a processing fee given the degree of customization of the protection of our software, the time spent and the risk of seeing our product counterfeit.</p>

    <p>9. Other Cost: The cost of the software or content in our website is limited to the content in the archive sent to the customer after the payment confirmation. In addition, the internet subscription, purchase or rental of NinjaTrader software or any other expenses related directly or indirectly to the use of our software is not inclusive fo the cost.
